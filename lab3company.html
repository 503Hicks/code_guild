Our goal is to create a casually social atmosphere for fashionista's, artist, entrepreneurs, and those alike that encourages conversation and caters to their lifestyle. Produce is not only a lifestyle brand that provides to men, women, and children, but a noteworthy destination for the Portland culture.

            Produce was inspired by the lack of resources in the Portland artist community. The city has a plethora of talented individuals interested in fashion, art, and music, but we have yet to develop the platforms and guidance necessary to take many artists to the next level. Produce will fill help to fill that void and help bridge the gap in our community. Not only will "fresh goods" be available at your local Produce store through our curated selection of apparel, footwear, accessories, & home decor, but we will create opportunities for the creative community of Portland.</p>
